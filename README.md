# colortime!
###### An app for color story exploration

We all get stuck in a color story rut every once in awhile.  Perhaps you're a fan of analogous colors, or can't get away from that lovely yellow/purples complimentary pair.

**Colortime** to the rescue!  Every time you visit, colortime suggests new colors - allowing you to develop unexpected and engaging color stories.
* Click on colors to add them to your color story
* Click on colors within your color story to remove them
* Copy the RGB codes with a click of a button so you can use your color story out in the world
* Refresh the page to get new colors (be sure to save your RGB colors elsewhere before doing this)
